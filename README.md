# NewSocOps

Empowering developers from underserved regions through micro‑grants, mentorship, and an open community.

Main hub (reports & governance) will live in a separate `community` repository (coming soon).  
Sponsor us: [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/NewSocOps)

Focus:
- Micro‑grants (catalytic small funding)
- Mentorship & learning pathways
- Transparent allocation & monthly impact reports

Get involved:
1. Sponsor to grow the grant pool.
2. Review and discuss grant applications (when active).
3. Help with future translations (English is canonical).

> Turning small sponsorships into big steps for emerging developers worldwide.
