# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a respectful, inclusive, and welcoming environment for developers from all backgrounds, especially those who are underserved or face barriers to opportunity.

## Expected Behavior

Community members are expected to:

- Be welcoming, patient, and considerate
- Assume good intent and seek clarification when needed
- Provide constructive, specific, and respectful feedback
- Respect privacy, cultural differences, and diverse perspectives
- Support and encourage fellow community members
- Focus on what is best for the community and our mission

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech of any kind
- Derogatory comments related to personal characteristics (including but not limited to race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or socioeconomic status)
- Doxxing or sharing private information without consent
- Sustained disruptive or off-topic behavior
- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
- Trolling, insulting comments, or personal attacks
- Any conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to:

**Email**: team@newsocops.org

If email is unavailable, you may open an issue labeled `conduct-report` with minimal detail. Maintainers will follow up privately. All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

## Enforcement

Violations may result in the following actions:

1. **Warning**: A private written warning with clarification of the violation
2. **Temporary Restrictions**: Temporary limits on participation (e.g., comment restrictions, temporary ban)
3. **Suspension**: A temporary ban from the community for a specified period
4. **Permanent Ban**: Immediate and permanent removal for severe or repeated violations

We aim for fairness and proportionality in enforcement. Each situation will be evaluated on its own merits, with consideration for context and intent.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all NewSocOps spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue discussions, pull requests, and any other community interactions.
