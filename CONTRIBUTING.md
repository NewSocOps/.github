# Contributing to NewSocOps

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NewSocOps! This repository contains our organizational profile and global issue templates. Program logic, community reports, and automation will live in a separate `community` repository.

## Scope of This Repository

This `.github` repository serves as the organizational hub for:

- Organization profile (`profile/README.md`)
- Issue templates for grant applications
- Community health files (Code of Conduct, Security Policy, etc.)
- Funding configuration

## How to Review Grant Applications

Grant applications are submitted as issues with the `grant-candidate` label. When reviewing:

1. **Check completeness**: Ensure all required fields are filled out thoughtfully
2. **Assess impact**: Consider how the project will benefit the applicant's community
3. **Evaluate feasibility**: Review the timeline and budget for realism
4. **Provide constructive feedback**: Ask clarifying questions or suggest improvements
5. **Be respectful**: Remember that applicants may face language or resource barriers

Community reviewers do not make final funding decisions but provide valuable input.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Focused changes**: Each PR should address a single concern or improvement
- **Clear descriptions**: Explain what you're changing and why
- **Reference issues**: Link related issues when applicable
- **No sensitive data**: Never include personal information, credentials, or private details
- **Test your changes**: Verify that YAML syntax is valid and Markdown renders correctly
