# Security Policy

## Scope
Security issues in any repository under the NewSocOps organization.

## Reporting
Email (placeholder): security@newsocops.org  
Include: affected repo, component/file, impact summary, reproduction steps.

We aim to acknowledge within 5 business days (may vary early on).

## Process
1. Validate report.
2. Work on a fix or mitigation.
3. Credit reporter (if consent given) in advisory or changelog.

## Please Do NOT
- Publicly disclose unpatched vulnerabilities.
- Share exploit details in public Issues before coordination.

## Out of Scope Examples
- Social engineering without technical vector.
- Issues requiring already privileged local access without escalation.
- Hypothetical DoS requiring unrealistic resource usage.

Thank you for helping keep the ecosystem safe.
