# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

NewSocOps takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any repository under the NewSocOps organization, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Email**: security@newsocops.org

Please include the following information in your report:

- Affected repository and component/file
- Description of the vulnerability
- Impact assessment (who is affected and how)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
- Suggested remediation (optional)

### Response Timeline

We aim to acknowledge security reports within 5 business days. During the early phase of the organization, response times may vary, but we are committed to addressing all valid reports.

### Responsible Disclosure Process

1. **Validation**: We will review and validate the reported vulnerability
2. **Mitigation**: We will work on a fix or appropriate mitigation
3. **Disclosure**: Once resolved, we will coordinate disclosure timing with you
4. **Credit**: With your consent, we will acknowledge your contribution in our security advisory or changelog

## What Not to Do

To protect the community, please:

- **Do not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they are patched
- **Do not** share exploit details in public issues or pull requests
- **Do not** attempt to access data that doesn't belong to you
- **Do not** perform testing that degrades service availability for others

## Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Social engineering attacks without a technical vulnerability
- Issues requiring privileged local access without privilege escalation
- Theoretical denial-of-service scenarios requiring unrealistic resource usage
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (please report to the upstream project)
- Issues in publicly archived or explicitly deprecated repositories

Thank you for helping keep the NewSocOps ecosystem safe and secure.
